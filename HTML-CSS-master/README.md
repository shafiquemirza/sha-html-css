# HTML-CSS

## Introduction

In this module you will learn HTML and CSS. HTML is the language in which you define the structure of the content of your pages (e.g. headings, paragraphs, links and images). CSS is used to write down how everything should look (e.g. font sizes, colors and positions). While learning the basics of these two languages, you will also get familiar with text editors and the developer tools of your browser.

We will focus on _responsive_ web development: you will learn how to make your website adapt to the size of the screen, using the _mobile first_ approach. Last but not least we will spend time practicing some soft skills that are important for becoming a good developer. These include: giving feedback to your colleagues, presenting and explaining your work, and finding documentation on the web.

>Please get yourself familiar with this repository by navigating your way through the different README files. Kind note: make sure to read assignment requirements properly for handing them in, in the end this saves both you and your teacher a lot of time. If you have any questions or something is not entirely clear, please ask/comment on Slack!
